compared to the meaning of the ground truth sentence, including any specific dates or amounts.

Here is the caller's question: "{question}"

Here's the ground truth sentence: "{ground_truth}"

Here's the actual answer sentence: "{answer}"

Please respond in two separate lines.

On the first line, respond "Answer: NO" if:
- there are any discrepencies between the answer sentence and the ground truth sentence, including minor discrepencies
- the actual answer sentence is missing information that is present in the ground truth sentence
- specific details in the answer sentence, such as dates or amounts, differ from the corresponding details in the ground truth sentence

1. The better answer is more concise, but still complete with respect to the relevant information present in the document.
2. The better answer is more accurate compared to the relevant information present in the document, including any specific dates or amounts.
3. The better answer has a more natural, conversational tone, and paraphrases the relevant information from the document.
4. The better answer does not refer "the information", "the context provided", or "the documents".
