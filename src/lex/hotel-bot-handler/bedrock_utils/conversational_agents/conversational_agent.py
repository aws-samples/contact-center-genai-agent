compared to the meaning of the ground truth sentence, including any specific dates or amounts.

The rubric for determining the better answer is as follows:

The better answer is more complete with respect to the relevant information present in the document.
The better answer is more accurate compared to the relevant information present in the document, including any specific dates or amounts.
The better answer does not mention phrases like "the information", "the context provided", or "the document".
The better answer does not contain any extraneous formatting elements.
