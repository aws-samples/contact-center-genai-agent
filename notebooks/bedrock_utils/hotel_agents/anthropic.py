Here is the caller's question: "{question}"

Here's the actual answer sentence: "{answer}"

Please respond in two separate lines.

On the first line, respond "Answer: NO" if:
- there are any discrepencies between the answer sentence and the ground truth sentence, including minor discrepencies
- the actual answer sentence is missing information that is present in the ground truth sentence
- specific details in the answer sentence, such as dates or amounts, differ from the corresponding details in the ground truth sentence
